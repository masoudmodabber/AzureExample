A simple azure project to demonstrate good practices in azure solutions. It also (eventually!) includs a github workflow to demonstrate to you how to set up your pipelines.
U can use this whereever u want but first try to understand what each part means. It looks painful to go in details but it saves u lots of trouble down the road.
I wanted to showcase IaC so I used pulumi for my azure infrastructure (as it's free!).
I will eventually add some security related measures to this to cover that part for u as well.
I have my own way of setting up my config and setting files. Feel free to use whatever is convinient for u (just use ur own way in any part that u think there is a better suited solution for u!)
